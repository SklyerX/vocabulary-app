## Why did I make this?

For my classes in school I was given a physical paper to store all my vocabularies and through out the semester I have to refer back to it and use it in my projects. I don't like the way the physical paper was and it would get destroyed in my bag. So I made this weird looking app to store my words in and easily refer back to it.

## Upcoming updates

- Ability to export as PDF
- Inviting users to view your vocabulary list.
- Share lists with friends and family via email

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
